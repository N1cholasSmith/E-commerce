## üìù Description
This is a back end application for an e-commerce site, created using a configured working Express API & sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, geenrating an estimate of $29 trillion in 2019. Due to their prevalence, the aim of this application is to demonstrate my understanding of the fundamental architecture of these platforms.

<a name="usage"></a>
## üñ• Usage 
This application allows you to navigate different link routes that display data from the database. 

- GET/ POST routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/products`<br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/categories` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/tags` <br>

     - If you wish to GET a certain id you can do so by adding an `/id` at the end of the link. 

- PUT/DELETE routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/products/:id`<br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/categories/:id` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/tags/:id` <br>

You can set these routes up and run tests using [insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/).
